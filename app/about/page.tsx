                It started in piano class. A group of DECA kids were presenting business pitches and I watched from the back thinking — I could make a better logo than that.
              </p>
              <p className="story-paragraph">
                So when my teacher gave us a business prompt and 10 minutes, I opened Canva and competed. The teacher judged. I was hooked.

              <p className="story-paragraph">
                Nobody had built the daily version of that feeling. I used to wake up at 3am to grind vocabulary.com leaderboards with a friend. Not because anyone told us to. Not for a grade. Just because the competition was addictive and we wanted to win.

                That's the feeling I'm trying to bottle — that same pull, but for entrepreneurial skills.

                In mid 2025, as a junior in high school, I wanted to build a place where high schoolers could find each other, share ideas, and actually collaborate on building something.
              </p>
              <p className="vision-paragraph">
                Then in March 2026 I combined both ideas into one.
